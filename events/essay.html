A script, circular with no beginning or end point, with an unspecified number of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/spect-actor" target="_blank">spectactors</a>.

<li><p class="bread"> the power of circular dramaturgy is that there is no beginning and no end which means that there is also no catharsis which means that there is no relief of the conflict of the story and in that case we might as well also give up the idea of a story and accept that there is no story there are multiple stories and we will never know all of them since each of us carry with us so many stories that together all of the stories in all of the bodies are too many for anyone to grasp.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">some of these bodies might have similar stories like when many people dream the same dream the same night in a common living area this happens just like it happens that many people share the same story although every time the same story happens the story is a little bit different which means that it is still not the same story but many different stories unfolding at once.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">these bodies might feel like they are stuck in a loop we can often feel like we are stuck in a loop for instance when the same story happens again and again for the same person and for many persons at once and over and over in different time and or different places.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">often the repetition of a story although in infinite variations points to structural conditions and when we find ourselves inside of these conditions we really don’t know how to not repeat a story.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">how do we do it? how do create a different story under the same conditions? do we change the conditions? how do we change the conditions? do we navigate these conditions in some genius way that no one ever thought about doing?</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">I think that in a circular dramaturgy we can be genius together and we can get lost in the loop because we repeat it over and over just like we do on a daily basis only here we get to observe ourselves together in different constellations while we do it and we get to laugh together and be scared together and not know how to change anything but be together with this longing to do it together anyways.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">the power of circular dramaturgy is that the theatrical piece has no answers it is nothing but an artificial imitation of reality with no other insights than the ones we get when we observe ourselves and each other navigate the conditions.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">we keep looking for ways out and merge all of our stories in an infinite number of variations in this loop that we are stuck in together and in this way we help each other to look for ways to change the conditions from within.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">there is no magic to circular dramaturgy and unfortunately in itself it doesn’t bring any solutions.</p></li> 
    
<li><p class="bread">circular dramaturgy is imitating trauma and the way trauma can make us repeat patterns.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">collective trauma can make us repeat patterns.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">individual trauma can make us repeat patterns.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">collective and individual trauma cannot be separated.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">there are always collective reasons for individual trauma and individual reasons for collective trauma.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">the artificial situation of an imitated loop allows us to be in a collective and individual body at the same time. As we read together we fluctuate between the collective and the individual experience of something that resembles life but isn't life itself.</p></li>  

<li><p class="bread">a state where we are real and not real at the same time.</p></li>  

<li><p class="bread">a state where we are echoes of the past and ghosts of the future.</p></li>  

<li><p class="bread">in between who we were and who will become.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">circular dramaturgy creates a rupture because without and end point in the performance the line between the performance and the non-performance becomes blurred and there is no applaud and no end point of the theatrical space because we who are anyone are the actors in the performance and in life and life and by observing repetition we observe the conditions we have to navigate.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">a state with a logic that is temporarily different than the states we find ourselves organized within a state where the logic of voices is different from what we are used to. Where we can take up space with silence and the loud voice looses power.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">a state without citizens a state where noone belongs in the story and the story belong to everyone present in time and space and present outside of time and space.</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">we enter a state of the global tragedie and repeat it together over and over and as we repeat it we begin to question why we do it why do we repeat it?</p></li> 

<li><p class="bread">in the first state of athens which is often referred to as the birth place of western democracy and theatre only every fourth person could vote only every fourth person had the right to be heard to have a voice and in todays states this have not changed much and is repeated over and over in variations.</p></li>  

<li><p class="bread">as everyday life seems like a loop absurd in content and shape we enter a state of unreality in the circular performance.</p></li>  

<li><p class="bread">For a while we ground because we meet in a space that imitates the absurdity of reality while asking us to be present in all of our absurdity of all of our absurd variations of the infinite, multiple now.</p></li>  

<li><p class="bread">in endless repetition we ground in the experiences of each other.</p></li>
